### Data and code for [Tran-Van-Minh et al. PLOS One paper.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0278053)

Do you have rabies tracing data? Are you planning to acquire some? Read the paper and try our code. The pdf version included here is easier to read, as it includes all the supplementary material. 

- for your own data, follow input dataformat in data/raw/
- jupyter notebooks step1_ to step8_ reproduce the analysis (already run in the repo, if you only want to reproduce figures, you can skip to that below)
- step9 recreates stimulation for figS20 (this can take a while and needs 64+ GB memory)
- jupyter notebooks in figures/plot_figXX reproduce figures
- tested on macOS with Python 3.9 and respective packages (except seaborn==0.11.1)
